# README for RealEstateCore (REC) DTDL Models

This README documentation remains to be written.

## Purpose

Although DTDL provides the schema by which developers can define the models of the entities they expect to use in their topologies, we are faced with problems such as developers not knowing where to start (i.e. “blank page syndrome”) or creating models so fragmented that make it impossible to integrate with other DTDL-based solutions (thus ruining the premise of DTDL providing a “plug and play” integration layer).
Our motivation is to provide an open-source ontology definition which learns from, builds on, and/or uses industry standards, meets the needs of downstream developers, and will be widely adopted and/or extended by the industry.
